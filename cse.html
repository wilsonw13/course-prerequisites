Case studies with slides, videos, and software demonstrations illustrate a range of approaches of sculptors incorporating computers in their creative process. Various state-of-the art fabrication technologies are studied (with site visits if available on campus). Mathematical foundations are emphasized so students can recognize them when analyzing sculpture and choose the right tool when designing. In the weekly laboratory, these ideas are reinforced with projects using a range of available software and inexpensive construction materials, e.g., paper, cardboard, and foamcore.</p>
