Students will be introduced to the mathematical methods required for the modeling of complex systems (including stochastic processes and both temporal and spatial dynamics) as well as to tools for computational simulation. Roughly one half of the class will focus on models for general cellular physiology, while the remaining half will focus on the development of higher-level models of a particular physiological system (for example, the neurobiological systems underlying learning). This course is offered as both AMS 332 and BIO 332 and is intended for STEM majors who have already completed the foundational courses in their major. Students who satisfy the pre-requisites but do not have a deeper background in some STEM field may find the class very challenging and should ask the instructor for guidance before registering.",
