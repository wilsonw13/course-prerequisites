As we discuss the metaphors or tropes of empire, we will also examine the concept of empire as a historical and contemporary formation, or what an empire meant in the 19th century and what it means today in the early 21st century. The course begins with the premise that travel narratives and modern visual culture illuminate the relationship between the violence and romance of travel. The course includes modern travel narratives (i.e. novels by Asian Americans) that focus on the lives of those who are forced to travel or migrate due to civil war, poverty and/or economic instability.

We will consider the great Heian Era women writers and their culture, examining the difference between men's and women's writing. From the Heian era we will move to the Meiji Era, when Japan's isolationist period had ended and centuries' worth of Western literature was introduced to Japan. We will concentrate on the writings of Higuchi Ichiyo, noting how the position of women had changed by her day and how it affected her literary style. The course will close with a focus on how literature treats Japanese women in our own time. This course is offered as AAS 331 and WST 331.",

        "description": "This course examines Japanese literature of the Meiji era, an era unique in the history of the world. Until the 1400s, Japan had no contact with the West due to its geographic location. After a brief and limited exposure to Western literature, Japan closed its doors to the West and remained isolated from approximately 1600 until 1868. During the Meiji Era (1868-1912) Japan was flooded with examples of all the phases of Western literature it had missed, and Japanese writers soon responded to the Western developments. This course will deal with that response, from Tsubouchi Shyoyo's criticism of modern Japanese novels and their lack of appreciation for Realism, to the development of the Japanese I-novel. Due to Japan's literary response to the West, it can also be argued that the Meiji Era marked the end of Japanese literature as a unique entity, and this course will explore this issue as well.",

The goal is to lay the background for an appreciation of the Black world in its diverse manifestations from Africa to the Americas (Latin America, United States, Canada, the Caribbean), from Asia (India, the Middle East) to Europe (Spain, France, England, etc.).",

Close readings of literature by authors from the 1950s to the present day, such as Chinua Achebe, Ngugi Wa Thiong'o, and Chimamanda Adichie unveil literary traditions, themes, and motifs specific to African writing. An examination of the writers' attention to topics such as (colonialism, ethnic war, gender oppression, migration, and Afropolitanism) allows for a critical analysis of the historical, social, and political issues on the African continent. The authors' discussions about globalization and its impact on African nations, particularly in relationship to the global marketplace, highlight the paradoxical nature of Africa's rich natural resources (oil, diamonds and coltan) against the continent's economic dependency on global investors. Postcolonialism, Feminism, and Psychoanalytic theory will enrich students' interpretation and analysis of the texts.",

Students will be introduced to the mathematical methods required for the modeling of complex systems (including stochastic processes and both temporal and spatial dynamics) as well as to tools for computational simulation. Roughly one half of the class will focus on models for general cellular physiology, while the remaining half will focus on the development of higher-level models of a particular physiological system (for example, the neurobiological systems underlying learning). This course is offered as both AMS 332 and BIO 332 and is intended for STEM majors who have already completed the foundational courses in their major. Students who satisfy the pre-requisites but do not have a deeper background in some STEM field may find the class very challenging and should ask the instructor for guidance before registering.",

The magnificent prehistoric paintings of multicolored horses, bison, and humans at the Lascaux and Altamira caves were created by artists living 30,000 years ago - but what came before it, and why did humans or their ancestors start being artistic? We will explore this chronologically, examining cave art and other early creative works, including bird-bone musical instruments, carved ivory figurines, shell ornaments, and older more disputed symbolic artifacts. Placed in broader archaeological context, we will learn about prehistoric cultures and debate the shamanistic, ecological, and hunting theories advanced to account for early art.",

Course topics include the cognitive abilities of early humans implied by their technologies, early human adaptation and social behavior, and the inter-relationships between stone tool technology, paleoecology, and hominin biological evolution. Lectures and practical exercises teach students how to document the archaeological record and how to use it to test hypotheses about early human behavior. Field excursions teach archaeological survey and excavation techniques. Students conduct research and report their findings in writing and in oral presentations. Evaluation is based on quizzes, a final exam, group projects, a research paper, and participation. This course is taught in Kenya during the Turkana Basin Institute Field School Study Abroad program.",

The discovery that some non-human animals, including birds, are capable tool users and in some cases tool makers offers exciting opportunities to examine such behaviors in living species. It opens up important implications for understanding animal intelligence, the emergence of culture and the supposed uniqueness of our own species. This class provides an overview of animal tool use and manufacture to compare and contrast the behavior of humans and animals.",

The chemical and physical transformations of the pollutants in the atmosphere are investigated and the phenomena of urban smog and acid rain are discussed. The impact of these pollutants on the planet\u00bfs climate are outlined. Current proposals of renewable energy supply and combatting temperature increase by geoengineering solutions are examined. This course discusses technical, ethical, and commercial perspectives that have shaped pollution producing industrial processes during historical times and in the present era. The efforts to formulate regulatory control mechanisms to limit the impact of air pollution and to ameliorate global warming are outlined in this class.",

Roughly one half of the class will focus on models for general cellular physiology, while the remaining half will focus on the development of higher-level models of a particular physiological system (for example, the neurobiological systems underlying learning). This course is offered as both AMS 332 and BIO 332 and is intended for STEM majors who have already completed the foundational courses in their major. Students who satisfy the pre-requisites but do not have a deeper background in some STEM field may find the class very challenging and should ask the instructor for guidance before registering.",

Scientists at Stony Brook University will be invited to present and discuss with students the application of these methods in their current research and in assigned primary publications. The laboratory component is divided into four modules designed to teach basic biochemistry techniques as well as develop the skills of problem solving and analytical thinking. The laboratory modules include: (1) classical biochemistry techniques to extract and quantify cellular constituents such as chlorophyll, DNA, RNA and proteins from Euglena gracilis, (2) characterize bovine catalase enzyme kinetics and design experiments to measure student's blood catalase levels, (3) purification of a His-tagged protein and the evaluation of its purity using SDS gel electrophoresis and western blot analysis, and (4) students will amplify and sequence their mitochondrial control region DNA and compare their sequence to known sequences dating back to the earliest hominids. For each set of experiments the students will need to write a lab report describing their own work and discuss their results in the light of previously published research.

They are also increasingly used to establish natural baselines to inform modern conservation efforts. This course represents a process and systems-based study of the marine and terrestrial fossil record. The course will focus on preservation and taphonomy, macroevolution, biomechanics, paleoecology, ecomorphology, biogeography, and the extinction of biotas in the context of the environmental history of Earth. The course format consists of a mix of lecture, discussion, and lab activities. This course will additionally take advantage of connections with the Turkana Basin Institute here at Stony Brook University, where researchers play an important role in understanding the evolution and paleoecology of East African ecosystems, including that of our own ancestors.

The behavior of organisms is examined to observe how they are constrained by the physical properties of biological materials. Locomotion strategies (or the lack thereof) are investigated for the forces and range of motions required and energy expenditures. Includes the relationship between form and function to illustrate how form dominates behavior. Presents the physiological effects of mechanical stresses on organs, pathologies that develop from abnormal stress, and how biological growth and adaptation arise as a natural response to the mechanics of living.",

        "description": "This is the initial course of the four-semester General-Chemistry/Organic-Chemistry sequence CHE 129/132/321/322. This sequence provides the necessary foundation for students who wish to pursue further coursework in chemistry. The General Chemistry Courses provide a broad introduction to the fundamental principles of chemistry, including substantial illustrative material drawn from the chemistry of inorganic, organic, and biochemical systems. The emphasis is on basic concepts, problem-solving, and factual material. Students will be placed into CHE 129 based on their performance in the Online Chemistry Placement and Preparation (OCPP) process. Specifically, CHE 129 is for students with chemistry knowledge above the required OCPP minimum but who do not meet the math corequisite of CHE 131. The level and content of CHE 129 match that of CHE 131, but since the corequisite differs, students must also attend a CHE 130 session each week. CHE 130 builds essential skills in information processing, critical and analytical thinking, quantitative reasoning, and problem solving. The CHE 129 four-semester sequence is inappropriate for students who satisfy the corequisites of CHE 131. It is also inappropriate for students who have completed an AP course in chemistry and received a score of 4 or 5; such students must enroll in CHE 152. Three lecture hours, one 80-minute workshop, and one CHE 130 session per week. CHE 129 may not be taken for credit in addition to CHE 131 or CHE 152. This course has been designated as a High Demand/Controlled Access (HD/CA) course. Students registering for HD/CA courses for the first time will have priority to do so.",

Among the techniques we use are improvisational theatre exercises that will help you connect with an audience, pay close and dynamic attention to others, read non-verbal cues, and respond freely without self-consciousness. We also will strongly focus on storytelling as a medium through which this communication shift occurs.",

Students attend a weekly seminar and work independently to create public-facing work that meets professional standards. They interact with members of the community and because the work is publicly available, students are exposed to the full range of community response. The final project will be judged on the accuracy, thoroughness, and originality of the project, the clarity and power of the writing and production, and the value added through presentation of research and findings using multimedia platforms. Students will be expected to work independently, demonstrate initiative and enterprise, and meet deadlines.",

This illustration is accompanied by an introduction to the implementation of programming languages, such as parsing, semantic analysis, symbol tables, memory allocation and code generation. Students complete a series of assignments to implement a language chosen by the instructor.",

Unit 1 (Ultimate Aspects of Sex) will review hypotheses related to recombination and anisogamy (different sized gametes), continuing on to sexual selection theory, which is the theoretical backbone for understanding sex differences in morphology and behavior. In Unit 2 (Proximate Aspects of Sex), we take a step back and discuss the genetic and hormonal mechanisms governing sex-typical development. Here we will also address alternative pathways of sexual differentiation, the physiological underpinnings of sexual motivation and sexual response, and puberty. Finally, in Unit 3 (Human Sexuality), we will take these two approaches and apply them to questions of human sexuality, addressing controversial topics such as mate choice, sexuality, sexual coercion, as well as more curious topics such as the evolution of the female orgasm and external testes.",

In the process, we will address questions such as: Why do humans invest so much in offspring and what factors influence individual differences in parental investment? What is the function of menopause? What is the purpose of a prolonged juvenile period (i.e., childhood)? And when and why should the pace of development accelerate or slow down? We will examine these questions from a comparative perspective, drawing not just on studies focusing on humans, but also on those focusing on nonhuman primates and other mammals.",

Any other course you take in economics will build in part upon the knowledge and skills you develop in ECO111, along with ECO 110. Hence, some fundamental concepts will be covered with some degree of complexity, even though this is an introductory course.",

This class, therefore, will focus on learning how to effectively utilize argumentative and counter-argumentative writing strategies. Students will explore an area of disciplinary interest to them through several stages--proposal, preliminary draft, multiple versions, literature review--culminating in a 20-30 page piece of writing in which they make a claim about a particular subject in that area of interest and support it with scholarly research and extensive elaboration.

Most importantly, this course explores the essential question of 'why' there is such an inequity and, oftentimes, 'who' permits or allows disparate treatment. As Dr. Robert Bullard states, \"who gets what, why, and how much?\" Understanding the moral questions that underpin environmental justice requires exploration from the sociopolitical standpoint, but also through legal, economic, policy, and historical standpoints on a domestic, international, and transnational scale. The course will include readings from sociology and political science texts and perspectives, as well as literary and film portrayals of environmental justice topics.

We will first study resilience through the lens of sociopolitical ecology of risk and vulnerability.

Finally we will discuss long term risk management, governance models, policies and politics involved in making our communities more resilient.",

The initial several experiments will be based on the fundamental single stage amplifiers. The rest of the experiments will be more design centric where students will have the responsibility to determine either topology or the values of the circuit elements in each experiment in order to satisfy specific design objectives. The lectures will cover the theoretical principles as well as related design tradeoffs. Different topologies and analysis techniques will be presented for each circuit, guiding students during the design process. This course has an associated fee.

Students learn to work in teams to complete a project from concept, practical design based on multiple constraints, to creating a deliverable product meeting the design specifications. Students present written, oral and poster presentations of the project. While most of the project work is done outside the classroom, guest speakers provide insight into other related topics from resume preparation, to program management, to team dynamics and to design methodologies used in industry. The project incorporates appropriate engineering standards and multiple realistic constraints. The final grade will be assigned at the end of the two course sequence ESE 440-441. Not counted as a technical elective. May not be taken for credit in addition to EEO 440. This course has an associated fee. Please see www.stonybrook.edu/coursefees for more information.",

        "description": "The senior design sequence (ESE 440 and ESE 441) is a two-semester, team based and independent capstone project with deliverables. The primary objective of the senior design course sequence is to provide a vehicle for students to transition from an academic environment to that of a commercial/professional engineering environment. Students learn to work in teams to complete a project from concept, practical design based on multiple constraints, to creating a deliverable product meeting the design specifications. Students present written, oral and poster presentations of the project. While most of the project work is done outside the classroom, guest speakers provide insight into other related topics from resume preparation, to program management, to team dynamics and to design methodologies used in industry. The project incorporates appropriate engineering standards and multiple realistic constraints. Not counted as a technical elective. May not be taken for credit in addition to EEO 441. This course has an associated fee. Please see www.stonybrook.edu/coursefees for more information.",

Through discussion and analysis of engineering disasters from nuclear meltdowns to stock market crashes to climate-driven catastrophes, this course will focus on how modern engineers learn from their mistakes in order to create designs that decrease the chance and severity of failure. The impact of engineers' values and ethics, as well as the crucial role of diversity and inclusiveness on successful engineering design, will be discussed in detail.",

        "description": "From the 16th to the 19th century, Europeans, Africans, and Native Americans all contributed to new knowledge production in the Americas in the realms of natural history, medicine, and early science. Within various colonial contexts, the drive to find, collect, and, where possible, commodify native plants, animals, and peoples played critical roles in larger contests to control people and places. As competing imperial powers sought to exploit natural resources and reshape entire regions in the service of empire, Indians and enslaved Africans variously resisted or contributed to those efforts. This course explores how changing concepts of the natural world impacted the development of science, medicine, and technology and influenced concepts of race, gender, class, and human adaptability. Readings will include current works by historians and other scholars as well as primary documents ranging from fantastical early travel narratives, to revealing accounts of Indian and African American medical/spiritual practitioners, to increasingly empirical studies by surveyors, engineers, and scientists in the 19th century.",

In doing so, the course will traverse the territory of nationalism, cultural imperialism, and cultural hybridity. The class focuses on the following sites of popular culture in particular: music, comics, telenovelas, cinema, sports, and food.",

        "description": "How globalized was the world before the modern period? What connected famous explorers like Marco Polo, Ibn Battuta, and Christopher Columbus to people who traveled the globe as part of their daily lives as merchants, diplomats, and sailors? Travel was a central feature of the medieval world and one of the primary factors that contributed to cultural contact, communication, exchange, and the diffusion of ideas between Europe, Africa and Asia in the pre-modern era. This course will explore the interconnected histories of the medieval world, focusing primarily on the Mediterranean world\u00bfLatin Christendom, Byzantium and the Islamic world\u00bfbetween roughly 500 and 1700. It will also devote attention to travel and travelers in the Atlantic world (including West Africa), the Indian Ocean, Central Asia, and China during the same period. Whether the motivation was exploration, piety, knowledge, survival, or profit, the act of travel involved the travelers in larger processes of interaction and exchange between cultures. We will examine the lives and accounts of pilgrims, merchants, scholars, slaves, and soldiers to investigate what motivated people to travel to, from, or within regions throughout the medieval world, and how they portrayed their experiences. With an emphasis on primary sources and class discussion, we will explore the writings of a diverse group of travelers and situate them within their larger social, cultural, and political contexts, while at the same time coming to terms with their reasons for travel and their particular world view.",

At war with indigenous peoples in its empire for almost the entire century, and faced with restive and even revolutionary laborers, Irish Home Rulers and suffragettes on the domestic front, Victorians formulated imaginary solutions to the real social and political problems faced at home and in the colonies, and these formulations of monsters, social or supernatural impacted nothing less than western conceptions of modernity itself. National and imperial developments across hemispheric and transoceanic space provide the larger contexts for the two assigned novels (about monsters) and historical narratives and primary sources (about Victorian society). Finally, the course also teaches historians how to use literary fiction as historical sources (a methodology distinct from but linked to that of literature departments), in conjunction with primary and secondary historical works.",

        "description": "Examines the 'great events' of the post World War period and the patterns of social, economic, and political change through the lens of British experience. In particular, we will attend to the impact of decolonization on issues of race, class and gender within British domestic culture. Britain entered the 20th century as the world's premier imperial power, the barometer of global technological, cultural, political and intellectual developments. As the empire disintegrated, wracked by world wars and nationalist revolts, the British state took up a different kind of revolution -- a 'socialist' revolution--that sought to give its citizens economic and social security 'from the cradle to the grave.' At the same time, British society was significantly enlivened, and further transformed, by the influx of immigrants from former colonies and the Commonwealth. The second half of the twentieth century thus marked the successes and failures of the twinned projects of socialism and decolonization, while also producing new kinds of mass cultural exports that continue to shape global culture. These narratives of changing configurations of empire, class, race, gender and politics are the subject of our course, and will be explored through imaginative and historical literature and film.",

        "description": "Although approximately 70% of Earth's surface is covered by water, this vast submerged expanse is often regarded as an unfathomable space with no history. Yet for thousands of years, humans have negotiated the oceans' heaving waves, plumbed their silent depths for marine resources, and at times been humbled by Poseidon's awesome force. In this course, we will explore the historical significance of oceans and coastal zones from social, economic, and environmental perspectives. We will also learn about the diversity of people's maritime experiences from the pre-modern period to today.",

Witches, judges, women, lawyers, bankrupts, laborers, Native Americans, servants and slaves are some of the groups we encounter in assessing the forces that shaped American legal culture and its institutions.

Using a diverse range of secondary and primary sources, including memoir, film, music, and diplomatic correspondence, this course examines the themes of guerrilla insurgency, military repression, student protest, youth counterculture, and U.S. interventionism during this transformative decade.",

The public adopts perceptions of journalists based on portrayals in the media, often without considering the accuracy and/or dramatization of these representations. Few people will ever witness a journalist in action. Yet many have very specific ideas of what journalists do because they have read about journalists in novels, short stories and comic books, and they have seen them in movies, television, plays, and cartoons. This class explores how these representations in the media contribute to public perceptions about journalists, and explores the trajectory of these perceptions from the days of silent films through the 21st century.",

In parallel with the colonial push into the Americas, Asia and the Pacific, journalistic narratives start to shape the Western view of the new worlds. But the process has a dual nature: these styles and genres are appropriated, re-signified and repurposed locally, giving birth to an array of journalisms that do not conform with their Western counterparts. Cro\u0301nicas, corridos, roman feuilleton, and a vast number of other forms of journalisms born in the Global South are discussed during this course. The class aims at expanding the Western idea of journalism as the watchdog of democracy, and to understanding journalism in the Global South in its historical context, within its political, pedagogical and literary roles.",

We start out by understanding how humans form social networks and what the properties of these networks are. We then compare how the emergence of social media has changed the manner in which we humans communicate, and investigate possible positive and negative effects of this change. One of the major effects is that many more people are 'publishing' today, and we will discover how this has affected public language use. We also discuss the technology behind social media, and learn about the dangers in social media. We also discuss the technologies used in social media, and learn about the potential and the dangers that lie in these technologies.",

The following analytical perspectives will be presented: speech act theory, ethnography of communication, linguistic politeness, and sequential organization of turn taking. This course is offered as both AAS 370 and LIN 370.",

This course provides a review of why sharks are important to our marine ecosystems, the influence of the media on public perceptions, and the challenges behind shark conservation.",

In the past few decades we have started to recognize how the loss of these species has caused substantial changes in terrestrial ecosystem diversity and function, mediated by changes in prey population dynamics and behavior. It is only recently that we have realized that changes in the abundance of apex predators in the ocean (e.g., sharks, marine mammals, tuna and other large predatory bony fish) may be causing similar changes in coastal and pelagic marine ecosystems. In this course we will (1) review the biology of key marine apex predators, (2) explore how 'top down' processes (predation and intimidation of prey) can influence marine ecosystems and (3) review the status of marine apex predators and how this relates to the current state of ocean ecosystems. We will draw from the primary literature, from both the terrestrial and marine realms, and host outside speakers who study these animals in the field.",

The challenges of writing human lives compels us to think ethically, legally, interpersonally, philosophically, often all at once. This course asks students to read extensively in the history of ethnography, reflecting on its key arguments and genealogies.",

We shall review the early history of quantum mechanics, and discuss some of the important debates at the founding of quantum mechanics. Students will not be expected to learn the mathematics in depth, only the introduction provided by the instructors aimed at non-science students. Besides readings, the course will also involve plays, films, and guest speakers. Students will be expected to work on a final project, to be presented in class.

We shall review the early history of quantum mechanics, and discuss some of the important debates at the founding of quantum mechanics. Students will not be expected to learn the mathematics in depth, only the introduction provided by the instructors aimed at non-science students. Besides readings, the course will also involve plays, films, and guest speakers. Students will be expected to work on a final project, to be presented in class.

        "description": "The study of politics has traditionally focused on factors such as demography, socioeconomic status, mobilization, electoral institutions, and social norms to answer questions of political attitude formation and political participation. However, scholars have recently begun to explore the possibility that biological differences may, at least in part, help to explain individual differences in political attitudes and behavior. This course explores the relationship between biology and political behavior with an emphasis on how the two may be linked. We examine human political behavior from evolutionary, genetic, and neurobiological perspectives, considering literature on non-human animals, developmental psychology, personality, psychophysiology, neurobiology, genetics, hormones, disgust sensitivity, and mating.",

For each social behavior, we consider the underlying psychological systems, how they process information, and what evolutionary functions they perform. We will focus particularly on evidence from experiments. Finally, we explore how humans invent new political institutions that extend our evolved political strategies.",

We will consider language broadly by looking at and experimenting with a range of communicative forms recruited to address social justice. \"",

Since the printing press, rhetoric and composition have been concerned with rhetoric in written word. Today, in the 21st century, we face digitality, defying any attempt to easily delineate speech, writing, and visuality. What does it mean to compose, interpret, and argue through digitality? What does it mean to practice rhetoric as a civic art when our communities are global and hyperconnected? This course explores the subfield of digital rhetoric, which aims to capture answers to these questions and more.",

This class, therefore, will focus on learning how to effectively utilize argumentative and counter-argumentative writing strategies. Students will explore an area of disciplinary interest to them through several stages--proposal, preliminary draft, multiple versions, literature review--culminating in a 20-30 page piece of writing in which they make a claim about a particular subject in that area of interest and support it with scholarly research and extensive elaboration.

We will begin with Japanese mythology focusing on the stories of the creator goddess and Amaterasu, the sun goddess, from whom the imperial line was descended. We will consider the great Heian Era women writers and their culture, examining the difference between men's and women's writing. From the Heian era we will move to the Meiji Era, when Japan's isolationist period had ended and centuries' worth of Western literature was introduced to Japan. We will concentrate on the writings of Higuchi Ichiyo, noting how the position of women had changed by her day and how it affected her literary style. The course will close with a focus on how literature treats Japanese women in our own time. This course is offered as AAS 331 and WST 331.",
