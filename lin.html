                     <p>An introduction to the fundamental areas and concepts of modern linguistics. Sounds and their structure, word structure, and sentence structure are discussed. Other topics may include historical linguistics (how languages change over time), dialects, writing systems, language and the brain, and psycholinguistics (especially the question of how children acquire a language).</p>

                     <p>An introduction to the analysis of complex words in English, especially those based on Latin and Greek models that comprise the majority of the vocabulary in the written language.  Students will be introduced to Latin and Greek roots and the processes by which complex words are built by affixing material to these roots and modifying their structure.  Students will acquire general analytical tools that will allow them to understand complex words that they may not have previously encountered. The course will introduce students to principles of linguistic morphology that extend beyond English to all human languages.</p>

                     <p>An introduction to how computers process language and solve language-related tasks. This course discusses the language technologies of our daily life --- spam filtering, machine translation, and many more --- and shows how they work under the hood. The course explores a variety of issues: Why do computers do well in some areas (spell checking) yet fail miserably in others (essay grading)? Will we ever have perfectly fluent AIs as depicted in science fiction? And how will these technological advances impact the role of language in our society? Students will also acquire basic programming skills and write scripts for simple language tasks. No previous training in mathematics or computer science required.</p>

This course will discuss how the languages of each family are related to each other, and what these relationships say about human origins and the peopling of the globe. The course will also analyze the world's languages in terms of the structures of their sentences, sounds, and words, and will discuss a number of global questions: Does your language affect your thought? What is the relation between politics and languages?  What is writing?  How do completely new languages emerge?</p>

                     <h3>LIN&nbsp;260: Language and Mind</h3>
                     <p>An introduction to the study of the human mind, starting with modern scientific investigations of language, and then its relationship with other systems such as music perception, visual narrative, numerical cognition as well as comparison to animal cognition. What is innate and what does "innateness" mean? Do the brain mechanisms subserving language also support musical and numerical cognition? How is language related to thought and to action? Students will be exposed to research across several disciplines (linguistics, psychology, and cognitive neuroscience) and will acquire a basic understanding of modern experimental tools for investigating the human mind.</p>

                     <p>Examines the pervasive interaction of language and politics, which falls at the intersection of Linguistics, Cultural Studies, Political Science, and Cultural Anthropology. Issues of language ideologies, politicization of language, linguistic markers of national, ethnic and sexual identity, language policy, bilingual education policy, and manipulation of linguistic metaphor in modern politics, both domestic and international, will be examined in detail. Students will explore the consequences for secessionist movement, language policy and linguistic human rights across a range of case studies.</p>

                     <p>Social media came into being along with the internet in the 1990s, and have rapidly become an ubiquitous form of communication and information.  This course provides an exploration of how language is used in social media, and how language in social media can be analyzed.  We start out by understanding how humans form social networks and what the properties of these networks are.  We then compare how the emergence of social media has changed the manner in which we humans communicate, and investigate possible positive and negative effects of this change.  One of the major effects is that many more people are 'publishing' today, and we will discover how this has affected public language use.  We also discuss the technology behind social media, and learn about the dangers in social media.  We also discuss the technologies used in social media, and learn about the potential and the dangers that lie in these technologies.</p>

We will examine data from a number of languages to explore the differences and similarities among the sound patterns of different languages, and will consider the question of whether there are universal preferences for specific types of sounds and sound sequences.</p>

Topics include basic speech acoustics, acoustic analysis, oral and nasal airflow, static palatography, linguography and electroglottography, as well as design of perception experiments.  Students will learn the physical processes affecting each experimental variable and common methods of analyzing each kind of data. Students will get hands-on experience with each analysis method and will use two or more types of data to explore a hypothesis about sound structure in English or some other language of interest. Students will learn how to use software for making measurements and analyzing data. Students will learn to assess the validity of claims about language based on their understanding of the scientific method as applied to speech. The course will give students a solid foundation for further courses in laboratory skills relevant to assessment of normal and disordered speech and for pursuing research, either as undergraduate researchers, or in the early stages of graduate work.</p>

                     <p>Focus will be on the language of a particular country or region in Europe and the relationship between language and the society, culture, history, and politics of the country or region. Designed for upper-division students, this course provides an in-depth study of a specific topic relating to Western civilization. Students will be expected to demonstrate knowledge of the development of the distinctive features of the history, institutions, economy, society, and culture of Western civilization, and relate it to that of other regions in the world. May be repeated as the language examined changes. May be repeated as the topic changes. LIN 355 and/or LIN 356 may be taken a total of two times for the major.</p>

                     <p>Through combination of theory and research from discourse linguistics and linguistic anthropology, this course examines (i) how culture shapes ways of speaking; (ii) how language constructs identities, dispositions, role relations; and (iii) what challenges people from different cultures may face when they communicate with each other. The following analytical perspectives will be presented: speech act theory, ethnography of communication, linguistic politeness, and sequential organization of turn taking.
